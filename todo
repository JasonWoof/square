    Contemplate
	consider caching options
		should cache the full text response
		top level should not be recalculated too often
			return cached rle + diffs until it's recalculated?
				this way chached locations would be just like subscribers
		how do we know what's popular? keep stats on most recent accesses?
	history
		how to show/navigate
		how to flag as nasty
	spam
		how to detect?
		ban users
		signups

    NOTES
	web address use this charset:
		-0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ_abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
	every 3 zooms adds another character to the url in this order:
		medium: ends with two periods, uses the t64 db column
		easy: ends with one period, uses the t128 db column
		hard: no periods, uses the the t32 db column
	The starting url is "" (hard)
	each db record contains a 128x128 tile (t128), and that tile scaled down to 50% (t64) and 25% (t32)

    Code
	make zoom-out animation (careful about what shows through as it shrinks)
	deal properly (ignore?) clicks during animations
	make it so you can edit!
		learn how to get coords of mouse clicks (see my color picker)

    Document
	data structure
	URL scheme
	renderer implementation

    Contemplate
	consider caching options
		popular/recent path
			to update (per changed pixel) update popcache set flip = 1 - flip where path = xxx;
*			how do we know what's popular?
		top level cached in every way
			cache ends of paths
			cache encoded 256x256 tiles from at least top three levels
*			reply to queries with cached value and update the cache periodically?
	make plan for replay/undo logs


    NOTES
	web address will pulls from this charset:
		abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890_-
	every 3 zooms adds another character to the url in this order:
		medium: ends with two periods, uses the t64 db column
		easy: ends with one period, uses the t128 db column
		hard: no periods, uses the the t32 db column
	The starting url is "" (hard)
	each db record contains a 128x128 tile, and a cache of that tile scaled down to 50% and 25%

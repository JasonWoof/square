SQUARE

This is a project to create a collaborative online art project. It is still in
early development. When released you will be able to:

1) Click on the square to zoom in.

2) Choose a "brush" size, and click to edit the square.

Editing the square consists of polarizing a square of any size. All squares are
fully alligned to their own grid size.

Polarizing means that everithing within it that was white is now black and vice
versa.

To display, the client sends a single AJAX request and the server sends back a
bitmap. The client (completely in javascript) slices this up and encodes it
into 16 PNG images, which are tiled to make the square you see. This encoding
is done on the client so that editing can be done locally, and server
communication is needed only to save.


STATUS

Editing is currently not implemented at all.

Zooming is mostly implemented.
